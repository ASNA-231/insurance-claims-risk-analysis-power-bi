# insurance-claims-risk-analysis-power-bi

This project analyzes insurance claim patterns using Power BI to identify which customer segments create the highest financial risk. The dashboard explores age, gender, car type, education level and usage behavior to understand claim distribution, risk exposure and driver characteristics. The insights support better underwriting decisions, pricing strategies and risk control in the insurance sector.
